### Created Summer 2015
- This is an example of a neural network written using Theano used to predict
the next word in a sequence.
- We will use this structure to learn vector representations for words
- We will use the t-SNE in order to visualize these representations in 2d.


### Updated with the data:
- Note that the data contains 250 words in the vocabulary,
and contains training, testing, and validation data.
